=begin

Write a method that takes a number as an argument. If the argument is a positive number,
return the negative of that number. If the number is 0 or negative, return the original number.

Examples:

negative(5) == -5
negative(-3) == -3
negative(0) == 0      # There's no such thing as -0 in ruby

=end

def negative(number)
  number.positive? ? -number : number
end

puts negative(5) == -5
puts negative(-3) == -3
puts negative(0) == 0      # There's no such thing as -0 in ruby
