=begin

Write a method that takes an integer argument, and returns an Array of all integers,
in sequence, between 1 and the argument.

You may assume that the argument will always be a valid integer that is greater than 0.

Examples:

sequence(5) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
sequence(3) == [1, 2, 3]
sequence(1) == [1]

=end

def sequence(number)
  sequence = []

  1.upto(number) do |count|
    sequence << count
  end

  sequence
end

puts sequence(5) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
puts sequence(3) == [1, 2, 3]
puts sequence(1) == [1]
